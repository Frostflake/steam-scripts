# How to use:
# 1. Install Python 3.
# 2. Install BeautifulSoup using "pip install bs4"
# 3. Visit https://store.steampowered.com/account/licenses/ and save the page as "licenses.html"
#    in the same folder as this script.
# 4. Run this script using "python comp-finder.py"
# 5. Check "licenses.txt" once the script finishes.
#
# What does it do:
# This script will go through the list of licenses on your account and find all of the Complimentary items.
# It will ignore free to play releases (aka anything with Remove).
#
# Why does this exist:
# Complimentary licenses do not always count towards your library count or drop cards
# so this can be useful for finding games to repurchase.
